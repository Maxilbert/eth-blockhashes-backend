# eth-blockhashes-backend
This is the backend test program for the blockhashes smart contract whcih can be found at https://github.com/Maxilbert/eth-blockhashes

The motiviation is to establish reliable mapping between block number and block hash in Ethereum, such that any smart contract will be able to get the historic blockhashes by seeing the contract (note that a live instance of the contract in Ropsten testnet can be found at https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xb11ea8d6bab4c557a781785425a2c5654f882663)

Before testing the code, use pip install ethereum and web3
